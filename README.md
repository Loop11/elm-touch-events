This package aims at handling touch (multitouch) events.

## Installation

```bash
elm-package install mpizenberg/elm-touch-events
```

## Usage

To try this package, please use a touchscreen platform (mobile, tablet, ...)
since mouses do not generate touch interactions.

You can find a complete very simple example of a single touch interaction
in the file `examples/singleTouch.elm`.

For a complete multitouch example, please refer to the file
`examples/multiTouch.elm`

## Documentation

The package documentation is available on the [elm package website][doc]
